# Angular and Cordova (Ionic) Front End Seed

This project is an application skeleton trying to be proposal to set up a complex [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) to develop with native mobile support.
The main idea is to use it to quickly bootstrap the Angular & Cordova webapp projects and dev environment for native mobile projects.

The folders contains a sample AngularJS application to handle a list of patients. And it is preconfigured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development tools for instant web development gratification.
The repo just shows how to wire some modules, controllers, directives, services and views together.
